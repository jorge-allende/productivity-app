# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Problem
The production app was experiencing authentication errors where `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` was returning null in Convex queries, despite the user being successfully synced via the `syncUser` mutation.

## Root Cause
The Convex authentication context wasn't properly configured to work with Auth0. The app was missing the necessary Auth0 integration setup that would pass authentication tokens from Auth0 to Convex.

## Quick Fix Implementation
Instead of implementing the full Auth0 integration (which requires configuration of Auth0 domain, audience, and ConvexProviderWithAuth0), we implemented a temporary fix:

1. **Modified all Convex queries and mutations** to accept an optional `auth0Id` parameter
2. **Updated authentication checks** to use either `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` or the passed `auth0Id`
3. **Modified frontend calls** to pass the current user's `auth0Id` along with other parameters

### Changes Made:

#### Backend (convex/tasks.ts)
```typescript
// Before
export const getTasks = query({
  args: {
    workspaceId: v.id("workspaces"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) {
      throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    }
    // ...
  }
});

// After
export const getTasks = query({
  args: {
    workspaceId: v.id("workspaces"),
    auth0Id: v.optional(v.string()), // Temporary auth parameter
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    const authSubject = identity?.subject || args.auth0Id;
    
    if (!authSubject) {
      throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    }
    // ...
  }
});
```

#### Frontend (src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)
```typescript
// Before
const convexTasks = useQuery(api.tasks.getTasks, 
  currentWorkspace ? { workspaceId: currentWorkspace.id } : "skip"
);

// After
const convexTasks = useQuery(api.tasks.getTasks, 
  currentWorkspace && currentUser ? { 
    workspaceId: currentWorkspace.id,
    auth0Id: currentUser.auth0Id 
  } : "skip"
);
```

## Future Improvements
This is a temporary fix. The proper solution would be to:

1. Install `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` or appropriate Auth0 SDK
2. Configure Auth0 domain and audience in environment variables
3. Set up `ConvexProviderWithAuth0` instead of basic `ConvexProvider`
4. Configure Convex Auth0 integration in `convex/auth.config.js`
5. Remove the temporary `auth0Id` parameters once proper auth is configured

## Security Considerations
- This approach still validates that the user exists and has access to the workspace
- The auth0Id is already known to the client (it's part of the user object)
- All access control checks remain in place
- This is suitable for a temporary fix but should be replaced with proper Auth0 integration
